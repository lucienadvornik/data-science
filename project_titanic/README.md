# Titanic Survival

## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced the survival of passengers. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and logistic regression modeling, the project aims to identify key variables affecting survival rates.

## Key Features
- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loads training and test datasets, displays basic statistics, and visualizes survival rates by gender, age, and passenger class.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and prepares features for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Implements logistic regression to predict survival based on selected features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with a confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
